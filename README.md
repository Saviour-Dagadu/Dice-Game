# My Dice Game Project using JavaScript
Introduction : 

Dice game is a simple fun game in which both the players have to see who get the highest score.  It has only two possible outcomes a draw, or a win for both players. We will be designing the game using JavaScript where a player will be playing against the computer. The player has to choose name and roll a die. A random option will be generated from the computer’s side and the one who has the highest score wins and will get one point every time. The game will be completely responsive so that it can be played on every device.

## How It's Made:
We will be building a Dice Game Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Dice Game is based on a two-player. Both players roll the dice and the player who gets the highest phase value will win the game.

Images of Dice Phases: The list of dice phases images are given below. Save all the images in a folder where you save your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can save all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files separately and link CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML file or combine all codes (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) in a single file and execute it.

Dice 1
Dice 2
Dice 3
Dice 4
Dice 5
Dice 6
HTML Code: HTML code is used to design the basic structure of the project. The HTML code contains the container class that holds the player’s name and initial dice phase. Another bottom div contains the two buttons (one button for roll the dice and another button for rename the player name).

JavaScript Code: The JavaScript code contains the functionality of Dice Game. The first functionality is to rename the player name after clicking the button. Another functionality is to roll the dice after clicking the button. After rolling the dice by both the player, anyone player will win who get the highest phase value. If both players get the same phase value then the game will draw.


**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.
